<p>The Devonian, the geologic period, is rendered 泥盆紀 in
Chinese. Having known of it from school as the period that evolved the
earliest plants with true roots and developed the first stable soils,
for the longest time I just figured it kind of made sense that they
would have named it the <i>Mud Basin Period</i>: 泥 (<i>ní</i>,"mud")
+ 盆 (<i>pén</i>, "basin, tub") + 紀 (<i>jì</i>, "period").</p>
<p>It turns out that I might have totally made that up. The actual
etymology goes like this: the Chinese word was orthographically
borrowed from the Japanese 泥盆紀, the first half of which was in turn
a phonetic transcription in <i>ateji</i>: 泥盆 (<i>debon</i>, "Devon")
+ 紀 (<i>-ki</i>, "period"). Looking this up was how I also learnt
that this geologic period got its name after this <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Great_Devonian_Controversy">big
argument about some plant fossils in South West England</a>.</p>
<p>Modern Japanese prefers デボン紀, where the borrowed syllables are
written in katakana.</p>
<p>Incidentally, the neighbouring Carboniferous (from Latin <i>carbo</i>,
"coal" + <i>-ferous</i>, "bearing") has a much less deceptive
translation: 石炭 (<i>sekitan</i>, "coal") + 紀 (<i>-ki</i>,
"period").</p>

<p>Throughout the Paleozoic and the Mesozoic, the Carboniferous is one of
the only two geologic periods with a name that is not a phonetic
transcription in Japanese. In Chinese it is one of only three. The
history of all the other ones follow mostly the same pattern as what
happened with <i>Devonian</i> &mdash; the English gets transcribed in
<i>ateji</i> gets orthographically borrowed into Chinese. Then, some
time later, back in Japanese the kanji are swapped out in favour of
katakana, while the Chinese translation remains oblivious to this
update.</p>
<p>The exceptions are these:</p>
<p>The Cretaceous (from Latin <i>cretaceus</i>, "chalk-like," from
<i>creta</i>, "chalk") became the Japanese 白堊 (<i>hakua</i>,
"chalk") + 紀 (<i>-ki</i>, "period"), which became the Chinese 白堊紀
&mdash; the same characters 白堊, now read <i>baí è</i>, also read
"chalk" in Chinese. It makes sense that 白亜紀 and 石炭紀 are the also
only ones that are still typically written in kanji, with the
additional wrinkle that today the character 亜 is <a
href="https://ja.wikipedia.org/wiki/%E5%90%8C%E9%9F%B3%E3%81%AE%E6%BC%A2%E5%AD%97%E3%81%AB%E3%82%88%E3%82%8B%E6%9B%B8%E3%81%8D%E3%81%8B%E3%81%88">preferred</a>
over the much rarer 堊.</p>
<p>The final outlier is the Permian period. Chinese borrowed 二疊紀 from
Japanese 二畳紀; modulo orthographic variations both of these read
literally "two-fold period". This ultimately has origin in the rock
strata in Middle Europe named <i>Dyas</i> in German for being composed
of two layers: the magnesian limestone <i>Zechstein</i> (German, from
"tough stone" or "mine stone") and the red sandstone
<i>Rotliegendes</i> ("underlying red"). These terms are still used for
the rock formations, but the convention eventually widely adopted is
to name the geochronologic unit instead after the formations from the
same age found in the medieval historical region of Great Perm, which
lies today in Russia. Japanese got on board with this and now calls it
ペルム紀 (<i>perumuki</i>), a change which is again not felt by the
Chinese terminology.</p>
