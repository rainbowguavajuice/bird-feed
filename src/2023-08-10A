The spectrum and the spectrum

Using the word "spectrum" in both "the spectrum of $a$ in $A$ is all
$\lambda$ such that $a-\lambda{\bf1}_A$ is not invertible" and "the
spectrum of $A$ is the space of all nonzero Banach algebra
homomorphisms $A\to{\Bbb C}$" has to be one of the more evil
terminology tricks i've seen in a while.

The trick is this: for an element $a$ in a unital commutative Banach
algebra $A$ over $C$, the set ${\rm spectrum}_1(a)$ turns out to be
exactly the set $\{h(a):h\in {\rm spectrum}_2(A)\}$.

This is a consequence of the observation that maximal ideals of $A$
are precisely the kernels of Banach algebra homomorphisms $A\to{\Bbb
C}$. Once we have convinced ourselves of this, the proof goes like
this: For $\lambda\in\sigma(a)$, let $f$ be the homomorphism whose
kernel is the maximal ideal containing $a-\lambda$; $\lambda=f(a)$
because $f(a)-\lambda=f(a-\lambda {\bf1}_A)=0$. In the other
direction, if $f:A\to C$ is a homomorphism, then $a-f(a)$, which lies
within the maximal ideal $\ker f$, must in particular not be a unit.
