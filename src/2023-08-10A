The spectrum and the spectrum

Using the word "spectrum" in both "the spectrum of $a$ in $A$ is all
$\lambda$ such that $a-\lambda{\bold 1}_A$ is not invertible" and "the
spectrum of $A$ is the space of all nonzero Banach algebra
homomorphisms $A\to{\Bbb C}$" has to be one of the more evil
terminology tricks I've seen in a while.

The trick is this: for an element $a$ in a unital commutative Banach
algebra $A$ over $C$, the set $\roman{spectrum}_1(a)$ turns out to be
exactly the set $\{h(a):h\in\roman{spectrum}_2(A)\}$.

This is a consequence of the observation that maximal ideals of $A$
are precisely the kernels of Banach algebra homomorphisms $A\to{\Bbb
C}$. (Explicitly: the maximal ideal ${\frak m}\subseteq A$ corresponds
to the projection $A\to A/{\frak m}\cong{\Bbb C}$. That $A/{\frak m}$
is isomorphic to $\Bbb C$ is Gelfand&ndash;Mazur; this isomorphism is
unique because there are no nontrivial algebra automorphisms of $\Bbb
C$.)

Now for $\lambda\in\roman{spectrum}_1(a)$, let $f$ be the homomorphism
whose kernel is the maximal ideal containing $a-\lambda$; then
$\lambda=f(a)$ because $f(a)-\lambda=f(a-\lambda{\bold 1}_A)=0$. In
the other direction: if $f:A\to C$ is a homomorphism, then $a-f(a)$,
which lies within the maximal ideal $\ker f$, must in particular not
be a unit.
