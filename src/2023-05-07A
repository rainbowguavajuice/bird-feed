Every nonempy compact subset of the complexes is the spectrum of an element in a Banach algebra

"The spectrum of an element in a Banach algebra is nonempty and
compact" is one of those funny theorems that I convinced myself of by
first seeing it invoked a bunch of times before I got around to paying
the karmic debt of actually learning the proof. Not knowing why it was
true in one direction was probably why it surprised me at first to
learn that it was also true in the other.

The witness to this fact is pretty underwhelming: the continuous
functions on $K$ are a Banach algebra, and $K$ is the spectrum of the
identity.
